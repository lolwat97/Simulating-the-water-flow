# Simulating-the-water-flow


This project will be about simulating the entire process of water flowing.

The whole idea will be based on computational fluid dynamics and I will try to realize these features: (Verb "try" means try)

Real-time mode;
Simple calculation scheme;
Open source code;
2D and 3D modes.

This project would be something new and really hard for me as python beginner, so it may take a while to even start doing something.
